Word Embeddings: A Hands-On Guide
=================================

Introduction
------------
Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words to be represented as vectors in a continuous vector space. This enables the capturing of semantic and syntactic nuances of words based on their context within a corpus. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of word embeddings, including their theory, implementation, and application.

Understanding Word Embeddings
-----------------------------
Word embeddings are foundational to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They offer a way to convert textual information into a form that computers can understand.

**What Are Word Embeddings?**
  Word embeddings are dense vectors of real numbers, one per word in your vocabulary. The position of a word within the vector space is learned from text and is based on the words that surround the word when it is used.

**Why Use Word Embeddings?**
  They capture not only the semantic meaning of words but also relationships between words. For example, embeddings can capture synonyms, antonyms, and more complex relationships like "king" to "queen".

**How Are Word Embeddings Created?**
  There are several models for creating word embeddings, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. These models are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words.

Key Models Explained
--------------------
**Word2Vec**
  Word2Vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words.

**GloVe**
  GloVe stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words by aggregating global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus.

**FastText**
  FastText extends Word2Vec to consider morphological information, by treating each word as composed of character n-grams. This can be particularly useful for understanding words not seen during training.

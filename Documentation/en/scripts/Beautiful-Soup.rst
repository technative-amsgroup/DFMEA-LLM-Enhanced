Introduction
------------

Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping purposes. It provides a convenient way to parse HTML and XML documents, extract data, and navigate the document structure.

    html_content = "<html><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1></body></html>"
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

- `find_all`: Find all occurrences of a specific tag.
- `parent`: Access the parent tag of a given tag.
- `children`: Access the direct children of a given tag.

Data Extraction

Once you have located the desired elements in the document, you can extract data from them using various methods and attributes provided by Beautiful Soup. Here are some examples:

- `text`: Get the textual content of a tag.
- `get`: Get the value of a specific attribute of a tag.
- `find_next_sibling`: Find the next sibling tag of the same level of a given tag.
